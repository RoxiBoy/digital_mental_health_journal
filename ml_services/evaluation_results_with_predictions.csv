"Today everything felt heavy. I stared at my thesis draft for two straight hours and barely wrote a sentence. It’s like my brain just froze. I keep wondering if I’m even smart enough to finish this degree. Everyone else seems to be moving forward while I’m just stuck, sinking quietly. I didn’t talk to anyone all day. Even my own thoughts felt distant, like they didn’t belong to me.",sadness,sadness,0.5317084193229675
"I walked home in the rain without an umbrella. It wasn’t pouring, but it was enough to soak through my hoodie. I didn’t even mind. It matched my mood.

"I tried to call Mom today but hung up before she answered. I didn’t know what to say. I love her, but I don’t want her to worry about me. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay. I just want someone to hug me and say it’s fine to fall apart for a bit.",sadness,fear,0.4552740752696991

"My friend cancelled plans again. Third time this month. I said it was fine, but I felt that weird sting. I wonder if I’m just the friend people talk to when they’re bored but drop when something better comes along. I shouldn’t care, but I do.",sadness,disgust,0.41980817914009094
The library was full today but somehow I felt lonelier than ever. Watching people study together made something in my chest ache. I wanted to ask someone to sit with me but my stupid pride got in the way. I hate how lonely I feel even when surrounded by people.,sadness,sadness,0.9644702076911926
"I saw my ex today by accident. Just a quick hello, but it ruined my mood. They looked happy. I pretended I was too. But walking away felt like ripping off a scab that was finally healing. I don’t know why it still hurts. It’s been months.",sadness,sadness,0.8730053305625916

I went for a walk at 2AM because I couldn’t sleep. The streets were completely empty and I felt like the last person on earth. It was peaceful but also incredibly lonely. I thought about my goals and couldn’t remember why I even wanted them in the first place.,sadness,neutral,0.4547240734100342
"Dad asked if I’m happy here. I lied and said yes. The truth is I haven’t felt genuinely happy in months. I laugh, sure. I smile when I have to. But underneath everything is this dull sadness I can’t shake off. Like background noise in my mind.",sadness,sadness,0.8232194781303406
"I deleted social media today. Seeing everyone’s “perfect lives” made me feel small. I know it’s all curated nonsense, but still. I wish I had something exciting to post. Something that made me proud. Right now all I have is anxiety and half-finished work.",sadness,joy,0.4649178087711334
"I miss my childhood home. Not the building itself, but the feeling of safety. Back when dinner was at 7, sleep was peaceful, and the future didn’t feel like a threat. Adulthood is overrated. Nobody warned me it would be this lonely.",sadness,neutral,0.6996409296989441

I saw a couple holding hands on the street. It made me think about how long it’s been since someone held mine. I’m scared I’ll get used to being alone. What if I already have? The idea of opening up to someone again feels exhausting.,sadness,sadness,0.4307308495044708
"A lecturer said, “Some of you won’t make it through this program.” He was joking, but it cut deep. I already fear that I’m one of those people. I’ve been working so hard, but it feels like I’m running in place. Every success feels temporary.",sadness,neutral,0.5645160675048828

"I tried talking about my feelings today but the words got stuck. I hate crying in front of people, so I just said I was tired. It’s easier to say “tired” than “sad.” Tired gets sympathy. Sad gets awkward silence.",sadness,neutral,0.5744102597236633
"I hate that I compare myself to others so much. I know it’s unhealthy, but when everyone seems happy, successful, in love… it’s hard not to wonder what’s wrong with me. Maybe nothing is wrong. Maybe this is just how life feels sometimes.",sadness,sadness,0.9714222550392151

I lay on the floor today and listened to the ceiling fan buzz. I didn’t move for fifteen minutes. It felt oddly peaceful. Sadness sometimes slows me down enough to notice the silence. But it also makes the silence feel like a void.,sadness,neutral,0.6289182901382446
"Got feedback on my assignment and it wasn’t great. Not terrible, but disappointing. I tried to shake it off but couldn’t. It’s not even about grades—it’s the fear that I’m failing at the one thing my future depends on.",sadness,sadness,0.4976363480091095
My chest felt tight all day. Anxiety mixed with sadness is exhausting. Like I’m waiting for something bad to happen even when nothing’s actually wrong. I wish my mind had an off switch. Just for a few hours of rest.,sadness,neutral,0.524861752986908
"I think people assume I’m strong because I don’t cry in public. But strength isn’t staying quiet—it’s asking for help. And I’m too scared to do that. I don’t want to be a burden. So I keep everything inside, even when it hurts.",sadness,fear,0.5621418952941895

Sometimes I think nobody truly knows me. Not because I’m mysterious—but because I don’t allow it. Sadness makes me cautious. I reveal pieces but never the whole picture. I wonder what it would feel like to be fully understood.,sadness,fear,0.6059724688529968

I passed someone in the hallway who looked genuinely happy. I envied them. I don’t need constant happiness—just a chance to feel hope again. I’m tired of sadness being my default setting. I want a reason to smile without forcing it.,sadness,joy,0.7587557435035706
I’m scared of telling people I’m sad because I fear they’ll see me differently. But keeping it inside is starting to feel like carrying a backpack full of bricks. I don’t know how much longer I can carry it alone.,sadness,neutral,0.42605698108673096
